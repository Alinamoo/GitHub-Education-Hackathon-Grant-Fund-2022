# The Pitt Challenge
The Pitt Challenge hackathon was held from Friday, October 21st starting at 5:00 pm to Saturday, October 22nd ending at 8:00 pm. 
The Pitt Challenge was held at the University of Pittsburgh's Benedum Hall in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and made possible by the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy and our generous sponsors.

## Event Summary
The Pitt Challenge brings together healthcare-based students and tech-based students who collaborate as teams to identify, understand, and create solutions for pressing problems in healthcare.
This year's Pitt Challenge marked a return to an in-person hackathon after it went virtual due to COIVD two years ago. The in-person setting eased the team formation process,
fostered greater collaboration and bonding within teams, and created opportunities for our teams to converse and learn from each other, our mentors, and our sponsors that would
otherwise have not been possible virtually. Some cool events we hosted during the hackathon were Morning Yoga, a DigitalOcean Workshop in which a speaker from DigitalOcean shared 
about DigitalOcean and demonstrated how to set up a virtual machine and database on DigitalOcean, and a Patient Engagement event by Gilead Sciences which gave participants the
opportunity to get feedback on their project ideas from patient representatives of underrepresented communities. Our MLH mentors also hosted a Bob Ross w/ MS Paint & Snyk 
Cybersecurity challenge events which were very fun!

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
 The target audience of our event included hackers of all skill levels, but especially novice hackers and students new to hackathons, as our hackathon did not restrict
 the number of participants or who could apply and was targeted at healthcare-based students who are unlikely to have participated in a hackathon before.

## Top Projects
We had some cool projects this time around, not the least of which is our 1st place Grand Prize-Winning team, Hey Alz's, project which utilized Virtual Reality
to help combat the progression of alzheimer's disease. We liked how creative their idea was, how they utilized another app, Polycam, to handle capturing the surroundings 
which allowed them to focus on the main aspects of their project, and how they made a mobile app for their project in such a short amount of time (link to their project's
Devpost: https://devpost.com/software/hey-alz).

## Whatâ€™s Next?
We're going to follow up with our hackers to get their feedback on our event to see what worked or didn't worked. Overall, we felt the hackathon was a success. With 90
registrants, we were surprised to see 29 teams formed and a low attrition rate, with 24 teams submitting a project for the hackathon. We also liked the spread of projects
covering various tracks, with the Patient Engagement track being a runaway hit with our teams this year. The dates for next year's hackathon haven't been decided yet.
