# Technica 2022
Technica is the non-profit organization behind <i>the world’s largest hackathon for underrepresented genders</i> as well as affiliated programs and events, organized by University of Maryland students. Technica’s hackathon takes place every fall, this year on <b>October 15-16, 2022</b>. Over the duration of 24 hours, Technica hackers are immersed in tech culture and encouraged to exercise their imagination to create interesting and innovative hacks. Striving to expand access to Technica’s unique community, Technica is a global, hybrid event both <b>in-person at The Hotel at The University of Maryland and online</b> via our custom virtual platform.

This year’s theme was “Reach New Heights!” We want to help all our hackers rise to the next level in their tech journey, whether that means tackling challenging new projects or writing your first line of code. We encourage you to be open-minded, be curious, and find your space in tech. Explore your untapped potential - the sky’s the limit at Technica! Whether we serve as a push in the right direction or a place for you to explore your curiosities, we hope that you are able to <b>#ReachNewHeights</b>!


## Event Summary

Within Technica weekend, we held <b>45</b> workshops, <b>10</b> mini-events, and <b>5</b> Techni-chats (community-building events)! Needless to say, hackers were always busy during Technica, learning, meeting new people, and having fun! GitHub and git were showcased in our Technica 101 event at the start of hacking and the star of the Beginner Track's Intro to Web Development workshop. Our favorite new mini-events include the midnight Glow Party in which hackers fashioned outfits with glow wire and put on a fashion show, Technica's Got Talent (open mic night), and the pop-up shop in which hackers could using their Techni-metro card to redeem bonus swag based on workshop participation!
