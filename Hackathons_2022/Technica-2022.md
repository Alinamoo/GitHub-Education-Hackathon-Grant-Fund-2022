# Technica 2022
Technica is the non-profit organization behind <i>the world’s largest hackathon for underrepresented genders</i> as well as affiliated programs and events, organized by University of Maryland students. Technica’s hackathon takes place every fall, this year on <b>October 15-16, 2022</b>. Over the duration of 24 hours, Technica hackers are immersed in tech culture and encouraged to exercise their imagination to create interesting and innovative hacks. Striving to expand access to Technica’s unique community, Technica is a global, hybrid event both <b>in-person at The Hotel at The University of Maryland and online</b> via our custom virtual platform.

This year’s theme was “Reach New Heights!” We want to help all our hackers rise to the next level in their tech journey, whether that means tackling challenging new projects or writing your first line of code. We encourage you to be open-minded, be curious, and find your space in tech. Explore your untapped potential - the sky’s the limit at Technica! Whether we serve as a push in the right direction or a place for you to explore your curiosities, we hope that you are able to <b>#ReachNewHeights</b>!
